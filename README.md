# Attempt at updating the Invasion mod.


--- Old notes are below here ---

## Improvements made in this fork

This fork aims to improve the Invasion Mod 1.7.10 version and fix long-standing bugs. Some **notable improvements** are:
- **Chat messages were greatly improved**, including colors and translations
- Added a **Nexus damage sound** (that really was necessary!)
- Fixed **11 missing sounds**
- Fixed **bugs** such as Infused Sword heart particles not being visible to other players or not being able to shift-click items into the Nexus
- Added a **German translation** (hopefully with more to come!)
- Several other **QoL improvements**!

## History
The very first version of the Invasion Mod for Beta 1.8.1 was [uploaded](https://web.archive.org/web/20171223101702/http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1278438-1-6-2-forge-invasion-mod-v0-12-0-so-you-think) to minecraftforum.net by Lieu and continously updated until 1.6.2.

More than a year later, UnstoppableN ported it to 1.6.4 up until 1.7.10 (see "Original forum thread" link above) and uploaded [their v1.1.2 source code](https://github.com/UnstoppableN/Invasion-mod) to GitHub. This is the last official release known to me.

In addition, a v1.1.5 of the Invasion Mod can be found as an [inofficial release](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/invasions) on CurseForge and on several third-party mirror websites.

As I've been loving this mod for quite some time now, I've decided to manually update the source code to v1.1.5 and proceed to add some simple changes I personally liked afterwards.

I'm also hoping that maybe this will help someone porting the mod to newer versions (also read the paragraph about them below!), as the 6 latest commits of the original GitHub repo are an unfinished refactor which make the mod unusable. I have removed them and instead updated the latest _working_ version.
## Newer Minecraft versions

By checking out the other forks of this project, you can find various (unreleased, probably unfinished) ports of the mod:
- 1.10.2 by [XenoDarth](https://github.com/XenoDarth/invasion1.2.0a-mc1.10.2) and (more recent) [crazysnailboy](https://github.com/crazysnailboy/Invasion)
- 1.12.2 by [DerToaster98](https://github.com/DerToaster98/Invasion) and (far more recent) [durinfab](https://github.com/durinfab/Invasion) (I've successfully compiled the latest version, but major bugs and crashes appear. Not recommended for ingame use.)
- 1.15.2 by [DolphinTechCodes](https://github.com/DolphinTechCodes/Invasion)
- 1.21(.1? .8?) by [Sollace](https://github.com/Sollace/Invasion-Mod)
**If you have the knowledge and the time, I'm sure many people would be happy to see this mod usable in 1.12.2 or even later versions!**
